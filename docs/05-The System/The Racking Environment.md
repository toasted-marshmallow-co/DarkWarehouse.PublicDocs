# The Environment
This page covers the terminology used describing the environment for an Omni-Mole system. The image below indicates some of the key concepts, these are explained in subheadings to follow.

## The AS/RS
This term refers to the full Omni-Mole system. AS/RS is an abbreviation for **Automated Storage and Retrieval System**. The Omni-Mole AS/RS is a type of AS/RS for palletised goods storage.

## Racking
The "racking" refers to the physical structure that hosts the machinery and pallets. This is generally built from roll-formed racking members (columns, beams, etc.). Some systems also utilise structural steel for the racking. Within the racking there are different concepts that are discussed in the subheadings to follow.

### Rails
The surfaces that the Omni-Moles travel on are called "rails". This comes from the classic "train rails" terminology. These are usually thick steel extrusions that do not deform when loaded Omni-Moles travel upon them.

### Storage Lanes / Lanes / Travel Lanes
The formal definition for a "lane" is any position in which an Omni-Mole is travelling forward/backward. Typically lanes are the racking used where Omni-Moles can store pallets (i.e. they provide a surface for pallets to be placed upon). There are lanes that serve no pallet storing purpose, either programmatically or by being mechanically unable to store pallets. Those are termed "travel lanes" as Omni-Moles/human operators can travel down these lanes unobstracted by pallets.

#### Lane Pallet Positions
Within a storage lane, typically a number of pallets can be stored (eg. 10 pallets). Lane pallet positions are the positions within a storage lane for storing pallets. In the example of a lane that stores 10 pallets, that implicies the lane will have 10 lane pallet positions.

#### Lane End Stops

### Cross-travel Aisles / Aisles
The formal definition for an "aisle" is any position in which an Omni-Mole can travel in the port/starboard direction. Aisles are used to "cross-travel" between storage/travel lanes, hence why they are termed "cross-travel aisles". Pallets can never be stored in aisles. 

#### An Aisle Position
Typically an "aisle position" requires that an Omni-Mole

#### Anti-fall Devices

### Grating / Walkways
