# Machine Basic Concepts
The Omni-Mole Automated Storage and Retrieval System is a type of automated pallet storage system that leverages deep lane storage with battery-operated shuttle robots. The intention of the system is to store and retrieve palletized goods. The Omni-Mole system is different to a conventional deep-lane storage system in that it allows the battery-operated shuttles to travel laterally between deep 

## Types of Machines

### Omni-Moles
The Omni-Mole is the core of the system. These are battery operated shuttles that move pallets. They can travel in lanes and in aisles.

### Vertical Transfer Units (VTUs)
The Vertical Transfer Unit or VTU is the elevator of the system. These are static machines, powered by 3-phase AC power. Their movement is restricted to only travel up/down. They are also only for machines and pallets. These machines allow Omni-Moles to travel in a 3D environment as they allow Omni-Moles to dock on them with/without a pallet and then travel either up/down to a different level.
