# Types of Machines


## Omni-Moles
The Omni-Mole is the core of the system. These are battery operated shuttles that move pallets. They can travel in lanes and in aisles.

## Vertical Transfer Units (VTUs)
The Vertical Transfer Unit or VTU is the elevator of the system. These are static machines, powered by 3-phase AC power. Their movement is restricted to only travel up/down. They are also only for machines and pallets. These machines allow Omni-Moles to travel in a 3D environment as they allow Omni-Moles to dock on them with/without a pallet and then travel either up/down to a different level.
