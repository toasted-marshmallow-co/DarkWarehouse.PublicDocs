# Interacting With Chargers ⚡

Understanding chargers and charge pads is crucial for maintaining the system's power🔌. This guide illustrates various methods that can be used to interact with chargers and charge pads.

## Understanding Chargers & Charge Pads 💡

### Chargers
Users can communicate with chargers in two ways: directly interacting with chargers (standalone) or indirectly using machines (remotely controlled)📡. Chargers can be identified within the system by the following icon:

### Charge Pads
Charge pads act as fuel stations where omni-moles can power up or recharge⛽. These power stations are indicated by the following icon:

## Using Charge Pads
Follow these simple steps to charge an omni-mole or interact with a charge pad using an omni-mole📋:

## Navigate To Toolbox 🔎

On the operations navigation bar, the user should click on the **Toolbox** button🔧. Once clicked, select the **Manage Traffic** menu in order to `Create Machine Movement`.

## Select Omni-Mole 📍

Choose the omni-mole that is intended for charging and click the **Next** button, when you have selected an omni-mole🎯.

## Destination

The user can immediately click the **Next** button to continue as the destination location is not needed⏩.

## Select Task Type

Once that has been completed, users can select the a **Task Type** of `Go To Charger` and click the **Next** button to complete operation🎉.

## Get Omni-Mole From Charger
Simply right-click the omni-mole and send it to the nearest available location 🖱.

## States Of Charge 🚦
Charging can go through several states, as discussed below:

- **Must Go To Charger**: If an omni-mole reports a charge percentage value of 35% or lower, it must go to a charge pad🚨.

- **Can Go To Charger**: If an omni-mole reports a charge percentage value of 40% or lower, it can go to a charge pad⚠️.

- **Can Leave Charger**: If an omni-mole reports a charge percentage value of 80% or higher, it can leave the charger✔️.

- **Full Cycle Cutoff**: If an omni-mole reports a charge percentage value of 95% or higher, it can leave the charger after a full cycle🔋.

- **Perform Full Charge Cycle Interval Min**: This is represents the minimum number of **days** in which a single omni-mole must go from a critically low battery state of charge to a full state of charge⏳.

- **Perform Full Charge Cycle Interval Max**: This, in turn, represents the maximum number of **days** in which a single omni-mole must go from a critically low battery state of charge to a full state of charge⌛.

This documentation provides comprehensive information on interacting with chargers and charge pads, along with the various states of charge users need to know🎓.
