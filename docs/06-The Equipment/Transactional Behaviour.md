# Transactional Behaviour
Understanding the heartbeat of our warehouse — the transactional behavior of machines — empowers you to navigate and manage the system efficiently.

Here's a closer look at how our machines operate on a transactional basis, much like the Mars Rover exploring distant planets. 👽

## Instructions & Feedback 🔀 
Just as the Mars Rover receives and acts on commands from millions of miles away, our warehouse machines accept instructions, execute them, and provide feedback on their performance. 

📏 This method ensures that every action is measured and accounted for.

Unlike an electric vehicle that runs as long as you keep pressing the throttle, our machines don't need constant input to operate. The Dark Warehouse software sends them predefined instructions, which they follow precisely, ensuring efficiency without the need for continuous communication.

### How It Works
**Sending Instructions 💬**: The software dispatches instructions to the machines, which then spring into action, much like sending a text message and waiting for a reply.

**Feedback on Execution 💬**: Once a task is complete, machines report back on how they carried out the instructions, ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Periodic Updates 💬**: Additionally, the software can check in on the machines, asking for live updates to gauge progress and smooth out any operational hiccups.

## Why Transactional? 🤔
The design choice for transactional behavior stems from our unique environment. 

🏗️📦 With vast steel structures and ever-changing pallet arrangements, connectivity can be a challenge. 

Instructions/feedback will typically be sent when machines have decent communication. This system ensures reliable communication and operation despite these potential obstacles.

## Importance of Transactional Nature 🎯
**Reliability 💪**: This approach guarantees that each instruction is executed correctly, maintaining the system's overall reliability. 

**Accountability 🧾**: Feedback from the machines provides a clear record of their actions, enhancing accountability. It also provides a clear _line of accountability_ between the Dark Warehouse software (instruction requester) and the machine execution (response provider).

**Troubleshooting 🔨**: Understanding this transactional nature is a powerful tool for users, especially when solving technical issues. It helps in pinpointing potential issues, tracking the flow of instructions, and maintaining the smooth operation of our automated warehouse.
