# Interlocks
Interlocks are special instructions where two machines are interacting with each other. These interactions are crucial for the operation of the AS/RS. 

🚦 The Dark Warehouse software needs to ensure that machines are interacting with each other correctly, ensuring every move is valid, safe and sound.

Safety first, always! 🛡

## Omni-Mole / VTU Interlocks 🐀🛗
These interlocks occur between Omni-Moles and Vertical Transfer Units (VTUs), ensuring safety at every turn.

An example of a Omni-Mole / VTU interlock is shown below in the software and then also in real life.

### Types
- **Drive In ➡️**: Like a green light at a pedestrian crossing, this interlock ensures Omni-Moles enter and stay within the VTU without a hitch.

- **Drive Out ⬅️**: This one’s like the gate lifting at a parking garage, making sure Omni-Moles exit the VTU smoothly.

- **Deposit Pallet 📦➡️**: Depositing pallets involves a fully loaded Omni-Mole entering a VTU and placing a pallet inside the VTU. The empty Omni-Mole can then exit in two ways:
  - Exit on Same Side as Entry
  - Exit on Opposite Side to Entry

- **Retrieve Pallet**: Retrieving pallets from the VTU involves an empty Omni-Mole entering the VTU and then exiting with the pallet. The loaded Omni-Mole can then exit in two ways:
  - Exit on Same Side as Entry
  - Exit on Opposite Side to Entry

## Omni-Mole / Charger Interlocks 🐀⚡
These interlocks are all about energy - making sure Omni-Moles get their power safely and efficiently.

An example of a Omni-Mole / charger interlock is shown below in the software and then also in real life.

### Types
- **Go to Charge Pad and Turn On ⚡➡️**: This interlock is like a valet for Omni-Moles, ensuring they park on the charge pad and start charging without any issues.

- **Leave Charge Pad and Turn Off 🫸⬅️**: Like saying goodbye at a drive-thru, this ensures Omni-Moles leave the charge pad and stop charging safely.

- **Toggle Charge Pad ⚡**: A simple on-off switch, this interlock lets Omni-Moles control the charge pad, ensuring safety and efficiency.

## VTU / Conveyor Interlocks 🛗🛤️
Creating a seamless connection between VTUs and conveyors, these interlocks are crucial for the safe transfer of pallets.

An example of a VTU / conveyor interlock is shown below in the software and then also in real life.
