# Locked Locations

Location locks are dynamic abstractions of location states within the AS/RS system. Locations by themselves are static entities but can be made dynamic through the use of location locks. The manner in which Machines (particularly OmnimMole and Vtus) can move around the system is in large part dicated by the lock configuration of the system.

There are various lock types within the AS/RS system and each serves a unique purpose.

## TMS Locks

TMS Locks are locks in the context of the Traffic Managment System.

### Manual Locks

Manual locks, as the name suggests, can be created by the operators manually and their function is to prevent machines from travelling to or through specific locations. 

For example, if the operator decides to lock an aisle the OmniMole will not be able to travel over or directly to that location entity. If a user decides to lock a Vtu lane, a Vtu will not be able to travel to or through that locked location. 

This can be very useful for a number of cases when strategizing routes that OmniMoles can take. It can also be used as a safety mechanism of sorts. If an incident has occurred within the AS/RS store, the operator can effectively redirect traffic from the affected area.
