# TMS Task Types

This page provides an overview of TMS Task Types. A TMS Task is used to define an action for the TMS to perform such as a machine or pallet being moved to a different location. This document will discuss the different task types.

## No Movement Tasks‚öôÔ∏è
No Movement Tasks do not involve any machine movement but instead get or update the state of a machine.
### Live Status Tasküîç
A Live Status Task is used to get the current state of a machine such as it's location, mode and error state.
#### Common Uses
- To update the location of a machine that has been manually moved.
- To get data on a machine in error
#### Requirements
- The machine needs to be switched on but does not need to be online in the TMS system.
### Mode Change Tasküö¶
A Mode Change Task is used to update the mode of a machine to setup, manual or auto.
#### Common Uses
- To update the machines state to auto after manual movement.
#### Requirements
- The machine needs to be switched on but does not need to be online in the TMS system.
### Emergency Stop Task‚õî
An Emergency Stop Task is used to enable the emergenecy stop on a machine. This will cause it to stop any current movement.
#### Common Uses
- In the case of an accident the machine should be emergency stopped.
#### Requirements
- The machine needs to be switched on but does not need to be online in the TMS system.
### Error Reset Tasküßπ
An Error Reset Task is used to reset any error on the machine.
#### Common Uses
- If the machine has a non-hardware related error.
#### Requirements
- The machine needs to be switched on but does not need to be online in the TMS system.
### How to Create

### Go To Nearest Available Locationüõ´
A Go To Nearest Available Location Task moves an Omni-Mole to the nearest location that is not currently occupied by a machine or in the way of any tasks.
#### Common Uses
- If an Omni-Mole needs to move away from it's current location but the destination does not matter.
#### Requirements
- The Omni-Mole needs to be switched on, online and in auto in the TMS system.
### Go To Charger‚ö°
A Go To Charger Task will send an Omni-Mole to the nearest available charger.
#### Common Uses
- To send an Omni-Mole to charge when low on battery.
#### Requirements
- The machine needs to be switched on, online and in auto in the TMS system.
