# Software Terminology 

Diving into the Dark Warehouse software can feel like learning a new language. But don't worry! 

📚 We're here to decode the jargon and acronyms for you. 

Below is a glossary of terms you'll come across while navigating our software:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **A bug** | When something unexpected happens that shouldn't. Our developers are on it! 🐛 |
| **Application Deployment / Release / Version** | The unique number identifying the version of the application that's up and running. 🏷️ |
| **Credentials** | The username and password you need for accessing secure resources. 🔐 |
| **Database** | Where all the data magic happens, storing everything the Dark Warehouse needs to operate. 🗃️ |
| **Database crashed** | When the database takes a little tumble and can't get up by itself. 🚨 |
| **Deploying the application** | Getting the latest version of our software up and running on the AS/RS. 🚀 |
| **Emulation** | A virtual test ground for developers to play with emulated machinery. 🖥️ |
| **Git ID** | A unique code snippet telling our developers exactly which version of code is running. 🆔 (_Example: 3f2e325fe0e0f4be83a310cfb64bce0e97c7a0e6_) |
| **History tables** | Archives within the database that store past decisions and actions. 📜 |
| **ID or GUID** | A unique identifier for data elements like pallets or machines. Think of it as a digital fingerprint. 🆔 Developers may ask for the task ID or some other ID when looking into bugs. (_Example: 30412f2a-086a-466a-9ae3-37c6e6798d19_) |
| **Logs** | A diary where the Dark Warehouse keeps notes on everything it does, including the occasional oopsie. 📖 It writes informative things here such as decisions it has made. It writes errors, warnings and fatal events within the app too! This is a good place to start looking to understand why a crash occurred. |
| **Network** | The local computer network onsite. Think of it as the digital roads within your warehouse. 🌐 |
| **Network speed / latency** | How fast data travels across your computer network. 🚅 |
| **Pipeline / deployment pipeline** | An automated conveyor belt that delivers the latest software version straight to the AS/RS. 🛤️ |
| **Remoting in** | Developers teleporting into your site's PCs to troubleshoot issues from afar. 🧙‍♂️ |
| **RF network** | The special network for chatting with the machines. It's like their private social club. 📡 This is different to the local computer network. |
| **Server** | The powerhouse PC running all our Dark Warehouse applications. 💻 |
| **Site** | The physical location of your warehouse where the magic happens. 📍 |
| **Tables / Collections** | The drawers within our digital filing cabinet (the database) where we keep all the data neat and tidy. 🗄️ |
| **Testing** | When our tech wizards are experimenting with new spells (features) or potion fixes (bug fixes). 🧪 |
| **The application crashed** | When one of our applications decides to take an unscheduled nap. 💤 |
| **Unexpected behaviour** | When the software does something surprising, but not necessarily wrong. The AS/RS is a multi-variable system and it is difficult for our brains to understand all the implications of a decision. It's all part of the adventure! 🎢 |
