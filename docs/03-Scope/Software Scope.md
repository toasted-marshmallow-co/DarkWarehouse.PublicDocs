# Software Scope
🌐 Welcome to the Dark Warehouse software suite! 

Our collection of web applications is like a well-oiled machine, working seamlessly together to manage the hustle and bustle of the Omni-Mole Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS). 

Our goal? To store and move pallets smoothly according to your business rules.

Understanding the scope of the Dark Warehouse software is crucial. It's like knowing what tools are in your toolbox 🛠️. With a clear grasp of what our software does, you'll be better equipped to tackle any technical challenges that come your way.


## Underlying Responsibilities
Picture the Dark Warehouse software as the brain 🧠 of the Omni-Mole AS/RS, sitting comfortably between your warehouse management software (like SAP) and the nitty-gritty of machine control. 

Here's a breakdown of what our software takes care of:

1. **Managing Communication with Machines** 🤖: We're all about clear and reliable chats with the machines, ensuring instructions are sent and received perfectly, even when tech gremlins like network or power failures try to cause chaos.
2. **Talking to Your Warehouse Management Software** 💬: We play nice with your warehouse management software (WMS), making sure we understand each other perfectly when it comes to stock movements in and out of your warehouse.
3. **From Stock Requests to Machine Moves** 📦➡️🚚: We take your WMS requests, juggle priorities, and make smart decisions on resource allocation to get things done efficiently.
4. **Smart Pallet Storage Strategies** 🧩: We're all about packing those pallets in the smartest way possible, keeping things efficient and minimizing aimless machine wanderings.
5. **Managing Machine Traffic** 🚦: Our software ensures machines take the best path, avoid obstacles, and, most importantly, steer clear of traffic jams and collisions.
6. **Clear User Feedback** 💻: Expect a modern, quirky UI that makes understanding this complex system as easy as pie.
7. **Dynamic Configurability** 🔧: Change is constant, and our software adapts with you, offering customizable strategies as your business evolves.
8. **Data Analytics** 📊: Dive into your warehouse operations data for insights that tell a broader story, all through meaningful dashboards and reports.

The 8 responsibilities are summarised by the diagram below.

## Logical Domains
Think of the Dark Warehouse software as divided into several "domains" or areas of functionality. These aren't separate apps but more like thematic groupings of features and responsibilities. 

:::tip
These domains are referred to throughout the application and often by the staff commissioning/running the system so it is good to know what these are.
:::

Here's a quick overview of these domains:

### Machine Communication 🗣️🤖
- Translating traffic management instructions into machine-speak.
- Making sure machines get (and acknowledge) their instructions clearly, even when things go wrong.

### Traffic Management System (TMS) 🚦
- Selecting the best resources for the job.
- Routing machines safely and efficiently.
- Keeping machine traffic smooth and collision-free.
- Overseeing machine energy levels to keep them charged and ready.

### Warehouse Management System (WMS) 📦
- Finding the perfect spot for each pallet.
- Selecting the right pallets for orders.
- Keeping things organized and accessible, even pre-staging orders when possible.

### Client Software Communication 🖥️💼
- Bridging the gap between your WMS and our software.
- Keeping communication clear, timely, and traceable.

Each of these domains plays a vital role in making the Dark Warehouse run like a dream. Stay tuned for more details on each!
