## 3D Canvas View and Notifications (default, low-fidelity view) üñºÔ∏è

In the DarkWarehouse, the low-fidelity 2D View of the 3D Canvas View serves as the primary interface for real-time operational oversight. Here, notifications emerge as interactive elements directly within the flow of your warehouse's digital twin.

This action to open the Notifications Portal can be performed from any page in the DarkWarehouse Portal, since it appears in the navigation bar. For instance, this is the view of the Notifications Portal when opened from the 3D Canvas View.

> **Note**: Here you are able to see the triggered notification pin on the 3D Canvas View, and the corresponding notification card in the Notifications Portal.

Upon clicking on the notification pin, a detailed notification card will appear, providing all the necessary information about the event. This card is designed to be informative and actionable, allowing you to address the notification directly from the card. The following screenshot shows the case where the user clicks on Acknowledge button to confirm the awareness of the notification.
