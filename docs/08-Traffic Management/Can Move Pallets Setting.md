# 'Can Move Pallets' Setting

This page provides an overview on the machine-related setting: 'Can Move Pallets' toggle. This details what the setting means and how to use them.

## 'Can Move Pallets' Machine Functionality üì¶

The DarkWarehouse has the ability to allow and disallow a machine's ability to perform pallet tasks. This gives the user an extra level of control over the machines. For example, if a machine is on it's way to pick up a pallet and the user then decides that that machine is needed for a maintenance checkup and want to send the machine to a certain area for a technician to take it out of the system, they can "Disallow Moving of Pallets" for that machine and send it a generic task to where they want it to go. If possible, the DarkWarehouse will then select another machine to fulfill it's original task.

On the UI, a machine is indicated as 'not allowed to perform pallet tasks' with a red crossed-out-pallet icon as depicted below. ‚ùåüì¶ \

This feature is only available to OmniMoles and VTUs.

### Allowed Moving of Pallets ‚úîÔ∏è

When a machine is allowed to perform pallet tasks, the DarkWarehouse sees that machine as available to perform any task in the system. This can be a generic movement, live status or pallet task.

### Disallowed Moving of Pallets ‚ùå

When a machine is not allowed to perform pallet tasks, it will only be able to perform live status and generic tasks. If a machine has a pallet on it when disallowed, it will still be allowed to perform generic tasks and will take into account the fact that it has a pallet on it when routing.

### OmniMoles

When an OmniMole is allowed to move pallets, it will have no indicator. This can be seen below.\
