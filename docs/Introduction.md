# Introduction
The Omni-Mole Automated Storage and Retrieval System is a type of automated pallet storage system that leverages deep lane pallet storage using battery-operated shuttle robots. The intention of the system is to store and retrieve palletized goods in a fully automated fashion. 

The Omni-Mole system is different to a conventional deep-lane storage system in that it allows the shuttles to travel laterally between deep lanes and vertically using an elevator. This allows the shuttles to operate in a 3D grid environment with minimal intervention from resources outside the environment. 

The DarkWarehouse software package is a collection of applications that are customly built to run an Omni-Mole system. The definitions section discusses all the basic definitions required by a user of the DarkWarehouse software when performing tasks within the Omni-Mole system.
